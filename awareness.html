    <h1>:dart: Cybersecurity Awareness</h1>
    <p>This was a cybersecurity awareness test conducted by the Cybersecurity Department.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this exercise is to show how important <strong>physical security</strong> is. Imagine if someone walked into the company and placed a random QR code like this one...</p>

    <p>It's also a reminder: <strong>Never scan random QR codes</strong>. It could be a trap designed to steal your personal or corporate data.</p>

    <p>If you scanned the code — no worries. Just <strong>keep the prank secret</strong> :wink: and let’s see who else might need a reminder.</p>

    <p>Stay safe, and thank you for being part of the <strong>#ZFamily</strong>.</p>
